The caDSR.owl file contains an OWL ontology created by the CEDAR team that has been used to store caDSR Common Data Elements (CDEs) as OWL instances. 

We downloaded all the caDSR production CDEs from [here](https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/caDSR/caDSR+Hosted+Data+Standards%2C+Downloads%2C+and+Transformation+Utilities) and developed [a tool](https://github.com/metadatacenter/cadsr2owl) that loads all CDEs from the XML file into the caDSR.owl ontology as OWL instances.
